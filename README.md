# Autonomous-Driving-with-Machine-Vision

Model to enable self-driving cars to navigate roads using computer vision

Uses Python/OpenCV and techniques like perspective transforms, Haar cascades, color segmentation and morphological operations to detect other vehicles, lanes, and traffic signs, and to calculate distance and speed of obstacles.
